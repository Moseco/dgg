# Unofficial Dgg chat app

This is an unofficial Dgg chat app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs).

You can install it from the Play Store by clicking [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.moseco.dgg).

Currently only Android is confirmed to be working, so some setup might be required to get an iOS build working.

## Building

### Basic

Follow the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) to get the framework up and running.

### Firebase

This project uses Firebase for analytics/crashlytics. To get a build working you will either need to [create a Firebase project on your own and add a config file](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview) or remove the Firebase related code manually.

If you want to remove Firebase, here is a rough list of what you need to do (at least for Android).

* Remove `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:x.x.x'` and `classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:x.x.x'` from `android/build.gradle`
* Remove `apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'` and `apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'` from `android/app/build.gradle`
* Remove `firebase_core` and `firebase_crashlytics:` and `firebase_analytics` from `pubspec.yaml`. Then go through `lib/` and delete any code that the editor now doesn't recognize.
